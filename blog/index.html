                        <p>I don't share very often about my enjoyment of designing and maintaining static websites. I figured that now was about time I created one attached to my real-life identity rather than a pseudonymous one. 

                        <p>There's surprisingly a lot to learn. I never bothered with layout responsiveness in the past, as the only intended audience for the website was me, and since I was not interested in viewing most websites on a smartphone, why should my site be any different? Of course, there's more than just one person that I want to look at this particular website, so learning CSS methods and techniques such as flexbox and media queries was new to me. I'd like to say I've picked up on it quickly, though - search engines are truly my best friend.

                        <p>The websites I designed were also reminiscent of 2000's-style web design - lots of pixel art, cute graphics, and a charming kitsch aura (by today's web design standards). You've probably heard of an aesthetic called "Fruitiger Aero", and my designs were similar to that. Perhaps I will include some examples of such layouts I created here - everyone could use a trip down memory lane! To switch from this sort of design to a more polished, "corporate" look was a challenge. I didn't want it to look too sterile and devoid of personality, but I also did not want to plaster kittens and strawberries in all four corners of the screen (though if you'd like to see that here, my email inbox is always open!). In the end, I settled for the best of both worlds - interesting enough for people to enjoy, but not something that might give you a virus.

                        <p>This website is to showcase, well, web design, and to blog about some technology-related things close to my heart. I hope you enjoy browsing!
