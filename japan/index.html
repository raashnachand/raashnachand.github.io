                <p>My 21st birthday present was a 10-day trip to Japan. I'm so thankful to my parents for funding this trip for me! I had an amazing time and I'm gonna talk all about it right here!

                <p>Of all countries, why did I request Japan? I wouldn't go as far as to say that I'm a weeaboo, but I did consume a lot of Japanese media as a teenager, mostly in the form of music. I love city pop (80's Japanese music), used to watch anime, and watched a lot of YouTube videos about different places in Japan, Japanese culture, and the Japanese language. I think it's a very beautiful country with lots of places to visit and admire. Plus, with the dire state of shipping prices, I thought it would be great to buy some vinyl records to take home, and also take advantage of the tax-free benefits. 

                <p>Six days of this trip were a guided tour around Japan from one company, three days were free, and one day and one evening were tours from a different company. I would have liked a little more freedom, but it was easier for my parents to have this kind of structure. And honestly, if I hadn't gone on a tour, I wouldn't have seen so many places in such a short amount of time! I probably would have gone to maybe 3 cities and spent most of my time in the general Tokyo area.

            <div class="text two">
                <p>We left my city on the 20th of June to go to Sydney first. This was incidentally my first time in Australia too, but we didn't venture outside the airport (and we couldn't because of how short our layover was). The airport was MASSIVE. There is no airport like it anywhere in New Zealand. There was also a large area of the international departure terminal shopping area dedicated to big-name shops - Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, Bulgari, the works. I'm not into these brands at all, but my sister is, and was far more enamoured by it. The ceiling here was so high and everything felt so grand.

                <p>We then left for Haneda. The flight was ~9 hours overnight. I did not have a good sleep. I'll have to factor that into my future long haul flights, because sleeping on planes is impossible for me. I brought an eye mask but didn't wear it, and I thought about buying noise-cancelling headphones but decided against it. I regret it, but I wonder if it would have made a difference because I just cannot sleep upright!

        <div class="container">
            <div class="text three">
                <p>We arrived around 7am Japan Time on the 21st. We had breakfast in the international departure terminal, which was just a burger and fries each… we were too tired to try anything new. We were also lucky the cashier spoke English… I could have ordered for us but my parents were quite insistent on ordering themselves.

                <p>We then Ubered to our hotel in Kamata, and we got there at about 9am. Check-in wasn't until 3pm, and we paid extra for us to check-in at 1pm because of how exhausted we were. So we had a look around our area. Keikyuu-Kamata station was extremely close by, and we had a look at the stores in the station. We visited Donki Hote, and bought some food in a supermarket for lunch. There was an arcade nearby with a lot of restaurants. One thing was for sure - there was no way we'd go hungry anywhere in Japan.

                <p>We had lunch in the dining area in our hotel and waited until 1pm. I tried to nap until then, but it's difficult when you're hunched over a table. Then check-in time arrived, we got to our rooms, and I went straight to bed until 5.

                <p>For dinner, we went to the arcade. I don't remember what we had and did not take photos. (I think my philosophy of 'living in the moment' has come to the detriment of memory recall.) I had a look at the TV and saw an episode of an anime that was basically "Free!" with girls instead of boys and bikes instead of swimming. There was also an episode of Kamen Rider Stronger.

            <div class="text three">
                <p>The next day was the start of our 6-day guided tour of Japan. The tour had about 36 other people in it, and we travelled in a coach. Our tour guide was super nice and shared with us a lot of information about the places we visited, the culture of Japan, language tips, and so much more. The majority of our fellow tourists were from Australia and the United States - we were the only Kiwis! It was fun to get to know these people. I learned some stuff from an American-Filipino about her career in chemical engineering and where the technology scene in the States was heading, and was suggested by a Sydneysider to consider Western Australia for my future work endeavours. I'll treasure these interactions a lot.

                <p>From Tokyo, we left for Kawaguchi lake to see Mount Fuji. It was breathtaking! I was quite worried that we wouldn't be able to see it because it rained in Kamata for all of the previous day. Moreover, that day was apparently the start of the rainy season in Japan. But the gods decided to clear up the sky the day we saw Mount Fuji, and thank the gods indeed. There wasn't much snow on it because the last snow was in April, but it was still majestic. I am and always will be obsessed with mountains. We spent a bit of time here, and I bought some souvenirs. There was a spot at our stopping point where there was a nice botanical garden.

                <p>We then went to a village called “Oshino Hakkai” near the mountain. Here we had our lunch. The village was teeming with tourists (like every single place we visited), but regardless the place was beautiful. I love rural Japan. The houses were so nice and the gardens were well-maintained. I'd love to retreat to a similar village for a few days in the future.

                <p>We stayed the night at Hamamatsu. Our original hotel was apparently overbooked, so all of us got upgraded from a 3-star hotel to a 4-star hotel owned by the same company! The vibe of this was somewhat antique. There was a small chapel on the second floor, and a nice lookout area on the top. We went to a mall called “Zaza City” (the name of which I find hilarious) and we had dinner there.

                <p>The 23rd was when we visited Nagoya castle. It was a fairly overcast day with some drizzle here and there. We went into a small building outside the main castle where we saw various rooms that the shogun of the time used for meetings, rest, etc. Eventually I got tired of seeing similar rooms with similar wall art. The buildings themselves looked beautiful on the outside though. I got to do a “ninja pose” with a ninja present there. One of the highlights of my trip!

                <p>On the way to Nara, we stopped over at Suzuka, the location of the Japanese Grand Prix. We were actually about 15 km from the racecourse, but this little service station was still pretty special. There was a Formula 1 car on display that was driven by Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger, and handprints of the 2018 podium. It's a shame that race-related souvenirs here were so poor. I didn't buy many.

                <p>Nara Deer Park and Tōdai-ji were our next stops. The park smelled like deer shit (which was everywhere) and I have a general fear of animals. So I didn't enjoy the deer, and DEFINITELY did not feed them. Others did, and some got their clothes ripped. But I enjoyed looking at them from afar, and enjoyed the few bambis present.

                <p>Tōdai-ji is a Buddhist temple with a 15 metre tall statue of the Buddha Vairocana. It was indeed pretty massive! Most of it was reconstructed several hundred years ago, but it's still impressive to think we were capable of creating such things more than a thousand years ago, and to see the results today.

                <p>Our hotel for the night was in Osaka, a walking distance to the Dōtonbori district. We didn't do much there that night, but we were staying in the same hotel the next day, so we held off on doing much apart from dinner. We did walk alongside a really pretty river. It’s a shame that it was downpouring.

                <p>The next day was a pretty active one. We visited Fushimi Inari Shrine, a Shinto shrine with about a gazillion of those famous red gates. The spiritual guardian of this shrine was a fox! Apparently a lot of foxes reside around the shrine, but we didn't see any. Then we visited Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, a path full of large, towering bamboo trees. Despite the other tourists present, it was pretty peaceful. We went on to Kinkaku-ji, a Buddhist temple covered in gold leaf. It looked truly majestic with the pond and garden surrounding it. Our final guided destination was the Gion district, home to the geisha. We did not see any geisha unfortunately, as we were too early for their performances, and they get dropped off by taxi anyway due to harassment by tourists. But the traditional buildings were still nice to see. We explored the Yasakusa Shinto shrine that was nearby too.

                <p>We did some shopping in Dōtonbori, and… we got lost on our way back to the hotel. I told my parents to just take an Uber since we had the address, but they refused. I was so exhausted by the end of it, but I had to wait even further since they decided to order dinner from a road-side restaurant instead of a convenience store, and we ended up waiting another half an hour. My legs were absolutely killing me. I walked 24k steps by the end of the day and fell dead asleep. I was planning on washing my hair this day too, but I decided to just wake up early the next day instead.

                <p>On the 25th, we went to the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum. I was going in expecting a bunch of cheesiness, but I learned a lot about the reality of ninjas, their spy methods, and their weapons. We had a demonstration by a “ninja” about such spy methods, and a show by two others about weapons used. Apparently they assist with productions of shows, and one of these shows had Akina Nakamori in it. I quite liked this part of the trip! It was really informative, and the show was funny and cute.

                <p>That night, we stayed in Shimizu. I spent the evening with a Japanese exchange student that came to my school back in 2020. It was nice to meet up with her again! Another acquaintance from my school was also travelling in Japan, and we were supposed to meet up as well, but unfortunately she was not able to make it. 

                <p>My friend brought along another friend, and we went to have yakitori at an izakaya. I had chicken neck and chicken thighs, and drank Japanese green tea-flavoured alcohol. Her friend brought along her sister afterwards, and we went to a karaoke bar. It was difficult to find songs we all had in common since I didn't listen to modern J-pop. The only ones we all sang together were “A Cruel Angel’s Thesis” and Kenshi Yonezu’s “Lemon”. They also knew a bit of Michael Jackson's “Beat It”. I sang Anri’s “I Can't Stop The Loneliness”, Yukiko Okada’s “Koi Hajimemashite”, Toshiki Kadomatsu’s “If You…” and Buck-Tick’s “Dress”. I sang the last because I think my friend’s friend's sister said she enjoyed visual-kei, but she didn't know that song… Me and my friend sang “Sugar” by Maroon 5 together (she only seemed to know the chorus though). I didn't note down all of the songs these people sang, but one was a song by Acid Black Cherry (I think it was “Jigsaw”), one was Fruits Zipper’s “Watashino Ichiban Kawaiitokoro”, and another was the Sailor Moon theme song. (I'm not THAT much of a weeb that I know it, sorry.)

                <p>The next day, 26th, was the last day for our guided tour. We went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building for a panoramic view of Tokyo. It was insane how much I could see. It was also the first time I saw homeless people on the trip… it's crazy that they're literally right outside the place where politicians convene, as if it was mocking them for how many problems still exist in Japan. We saw the Tokyo Skytree as well. I don't think I'll ever see another building taller than that.

                <p>We went to Asakusa to see Sensō-ji. By this point I'd gotten thoroughly sick of seeing Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, so I didn't explore it much and just had some lunch. Afterwards, we went back to our hotel in Kamata, where we just chilled out in our rooms, had some dinner at the arcade and planned what we'd do on the next two days, which were free.

                <p>The next day, we checked out of our hotel, but kept our bags there. We went to Shibuya to do some shopping, mostly for me and my sister. Our first stop was Brandy Melville, a shop my sister wanted to go to. She got a few clothes, and I ended up buying a shirt for myself too. I also got some button pins and stickers that were completely free.

                <p>We went to Tower Records, my shop. I was there for the vinyl. I had a browse on the third floor where the city pop CDs were, and the 6th floor where all vinyl was present. The list of records I bought were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Timely!! - Anri (reissue)
                    <li>Cool - Anri (reissue)
                    <li>Touch and Go - Toshiki Kadomatsu
                    <li>Mind Game - Miho Nakayama

                <p>Afterwards, my sister wanted to visit BAPE, a designer clothing store in the vein of Supreme and Balenciaga. I'm not really into this kind of thing. I must be out of touch. We had some lunch at an Indian restaurant before going to another record shop by Shibuya station and the Shibuya crossing, Recofan. I bought even more stuff here:

                <ul>
                    <li>My Sanctuary - Reimy
                    <li>First Finale - S. Kiyotaka and Omega Tribe
                    <li>Paper Moon - Junko Ohashi
                    <li>Delication - Etsuko Sai
                    <li>Groovin’ - Toshinobu Kubota
                    <li>Super Chance - 1986 Omega Tribe
                    <li>The Soundgraphy - Casiopea (a gift for a friend, not pictured)

            <div class="text four">
                <p>We went back to our hotel to pick up our bags, and then went to an apartment in Asakusa we had booked for the next two nights. We bought some convenience store food for dinner before we went on a guided tour by a different company seeing the lights of Tokyo. This time we only travelled as a family in a single car. The company seem to be catered towards Filipinos mainly, and our tour guide was half-Filipino, half-Japanese. We talked to him about his background, and he's working three jobs to support his wife and three kids. It was eye-opening to realise that there was a significant Filipino population in Japan. I'd always thought of the nation as ethnically homogenous.

                <p>The first place we went to was Ueno. Here there was a market with lots of stuff - seafood, produce, clothes, and miscellaneous services. Most of the markets we went to only specialized in a specific area. We were pretty thrilled by the fish and animals that were there. Mum wanted to go to Tsukiji Fish Market but this was a great substitute.

                <p>Akihabara was the next stop. I'm not much into anime anymore but it was still cool to see the lights and shops. There were a lot of girls handing out pamphlets and dressed up in cute clothing (lolita and maid) that I later learned were idols or maids in the maid cafes. I took a few pamphlets just to be nice.

                <p>Then we travelled to Odaiba. The concept of a man-made island created in the 1800s is a bit wild to me. There was a Gundam light show that seems to go on every night. We walked to a viewpoint where we saw the Rainbow Bridge, and a small version of the Statue of Liberty. I could also claim I went to New York now, I guess.

                <p>We were supposed to do a short tour of Asakusa too, but we were tired, so we asked the tour guide to take us back to our apartment to retire for the night.

                <p>The 28th had torrential rain, so we decided to just chill out for most of the day at home. I read my book, “The Secret Garden”. Dad went to get lunch and got lost on the way back. Turned out he was on the street next to ours… We did a bit of shopping in the evening in Asakusa Rox, mostly chocolates and gifts for others.

                <p>After shopping, I hung out with another exchange student who came to my school in 2021. We went to two restaurants - the first didn't have many options to fit my dietary requirements, but we had some anchovy fries and chicken thighs. I had a glass of Asahi Super Dry, which didn't taste much different from any other lager I've tried. My friend had a pomegranate cocktail. I had a sip and it was so much better. The next restaurant had a lot more chicken, but I was quite full, so I only had chicken meatballs. She had a bunch of stuff, including chicken gristle, which I tried and found thoroughly unpleasant. I drank a Cassis Milk cocktail, which was strawberry flavoured and delicious. I couldn't even taste the alcohol! Maybe I should try Cassis more often, when I can find it. For dessert, I had an ice cream mochi, also strawberry flavoured. My friend had a soy sauce flavoured one, which was also delicious. It was great to hang out with her again too!

                <p>29th… our last day in Japan :( Today was a tour of Yokohama. Our tour guide was a different person from the same company. We were supposed to finish up by 4 but ended up skipping some stuff and finished by about 2. First we went to the Cup Noodle museum, but we didn't really have any interest in it, so we just browsed the shop. We hung out by the bay for an hour before we visited Cosmo World, an amusement park. The only ride we went on was the massive ferris wheel. We got some okay pictures of Yokohama from there. It wasn't that scary and the wheel rotated extremely slowly. Here we had some ice cream. We had a look through the Red Brick Warehouse, a building that used to be a customs site but is now a shopping and food complex. Outside there was a wine-tasting festival occurring.

                <p>We went to Chinatown to have lunch. I wouldn't have minded doing a palm reading there if I understood Japanese or Mandarin. It was during this time that I realised just how weak the yen is. You wouldn't figure that out from the JPY/NZD exchange rate alone, but it becomes obvious when you spend $85 for meals for four, and it would cost you probably $120 easily in New Zealand. I heard that the yen is now at a 37-year low, so if you're thinking of shopping in Japan, I suppose now is the time to do it.

                <p>After this we went to Narita airport. We reached there at about 3:00pm, and check-in wasn't open until 5:30pm… a long wait like the start of our trip. I napped until check-in, after which we had dinner and went to the duty-free area to do some more last-minute shopping. The time flew by fast, and by the time we reached our gate, we had just an hour before boarding.

                <p>On the flight to Brisbane, I watched a movie called “Saltburn” because my sister had recommended it. I didn't enjoy it at all, so that was several hours wasted. I could have used it for sleep instead... but I had trouble falling asleep again.

                <p>The layover at Brisbane was also short, so we didn't venture outside the airport. We had some breakfast before the flight back to our city. Unlike my previous flights on this trip, I bagged a window seat. I took photos of what I think was the Gold Coast, and of New Zealand when I got there.

                <p>Souvenir buying was a lot more difficult for me than I expected. My ideal souvenirs are objects that I can “use up” quickly (such as food, soap, etc), and this was difficult to look for. I had to be mindful of customs requirements when selecting food, and the most common souvenir items were keychains, magnets, single stickers, and miscellaneous decorations.

                <p>I got a small array of souvenirs for six people - five who live in my general area, and one whom I will probably ship to since he lives in Ireland. Shipping costs $40…
