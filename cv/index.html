                        <br>Conducted risk assessment of an aircraft service application using the STRIDE method and a set of security cards provided by the University of Washington.
                        <br>- Identified ways that abuse of the system could directly or indirectly impact stakeholders by using security cards as a guide and the STRIDE method on each element of the system.
                        <br>- Described threats and selected the most realistic threats with reasoning. Proposed mitigations to threats.

                        <p><strong>Personal website</strong>
                        <br>A website to showcase web design skills, for blogging, and for cataloguing.
                        <br>- Formatted content using HTML and created designs using CSS. Validated markup for cross-browser compatibility.
                        <br>- Created mobile responsive layouts for smartphone users.
