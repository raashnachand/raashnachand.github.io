                        <p>Hi, I'm Raashna. I'm a final-year Bachelor of Science student at Victoria University of Wellington, majoring in Computer Science with a specialisation in cybersecurity. I also enjoy experiencing emotional rollercoasters with Brighton and Hove Albion FC, moving around heavy weights, and nodding approvingly at my record collection.
                        <p>This website is reminiscent of old Tumblr themes for desktop from 2017-2020. It was fun to customise these to my heart's extent, and I'd like to pay tribute to the old-school feel of these themes while also keeping the look updated and fresh.
                        <p>If you're stuck on what to look through, I highly recommend reading my trip to Japan. I made it look nice for you!

                        <p>I don't share very often about my enjoyment of designing and maintaining static websites. I figured that now was about time I created one attached to my real-life identity rather than a pseudononymous one. 

                        <p>There's surprisingly a lot to learn. <a href="blog/#1">Keep reading...</a>
